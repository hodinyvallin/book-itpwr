# EXERCISE 3

=begin

Exception handling is the process of managing unforeseen exceptions/errors through changing the flow of control. 
This solves the problem of your program ending abruptly if/when an exception is raised, before completing execution. 
If your program encounters an exception, exception handling provides a way for your program to manage it, and then continue executing the rest of the code.
